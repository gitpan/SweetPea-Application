ORM Relationship Management

#uses $u->current joins permissions table using yaml defined relationship
# equal to select * from users, permissions where users.id = permissions.user
# permissions would be a shortcut to $s->dbo->permissions->read({ relationship });

# one-to-many
# one-to-one
# many-to-many
